My To-Do-List application was designed to enable the user to select from the menu option:
  Welcome to the To-Do List App!

        Menu:
        1. Add a task
        2. View tasks
        3. Mark a task as complete
        4. Delete a task
        5. Quit

It starts by displaying a welcome message "Welcome to the To-Do List App!". Then displaying the Menu.
I have chosen a to do list which is "eat","wash","clean","shower","work","excercise".

The program is supposed to allow the user to input a number from 1-5 to allow them to add a task, view tasks, mark task as complete, delete tasks or quit the application. 

If the user inputs an option that is not valid, the program will recognize it and use a try block to avoid the program from crashing.
